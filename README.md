# Soft166 - Website
This is my Github page for my SOFT166 coursework.

####Application description
The aim behind this work was to create a functioning website that had a dedicated page for a password strength tester, this application was then to be linked to smart lights that would use third party application program interface to interact with said program. 

My strength tester would illuminate the lights from red to green when the user entered password meant certain password requirements such as containing a number or being at least 8 charters long. Through out the process of coding the site was to get user feedback, use project management tools such as Trello and then use version control by means of GitHub.

The application should be quite easy to use due to its simplistic layout and placeholders such “Type Here”, The user simply has to start typing in their password and the red text will change to green once that specific requirement has been met. 

These 5 Password requirements are:
•	Numbers
•	Lowercase letters
•	Capital Letters
•	Symbols (e.g.!@#\$%\^&)
•	At Least 8 Characters
